# React Quiz App

This project created during "The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More" Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

In this project, main goal was to practice useReducer hook. With the help of useReducer and other hooks, we've been able to add multiple features to the app. Such as handling loading/error/ready status, starting quiz, handling answers, setting up a timer etc.

Moreover, this project made it perfectly clear the differences between useState and useReducer hooks.

Hereâ€™s how it looks like;
